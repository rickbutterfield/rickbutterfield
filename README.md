# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Rick, and I'm a full stack lead software engineer from the UK.**

I'm currently working as Development Team Lead for [Nexer Digital](https://nexerdigital.com/) where I get to build websites and software. This means I'm working across tech stacksâ€”C# .NET, SQL and Umbraco as well as HTML, CSS/Sass, JS/ES6+ and Node.

I'm an [Umbraco MVP](https://umbraco.com/blog/the-umbraco-2023-mvps/) and part of the [Umbraco Community Sustainability Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/).
