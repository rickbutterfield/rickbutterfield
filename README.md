# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Rick, and I'm a full stack lead software engineer from the UK.

I'm currently working as Development Team Lead for Nexer Digital where I get to build websites and software. This means I'm working across tech stacksâ€”C# .NET, SQL and Umbraco as well as HTML, CSS/Sass, JS/ES6+ and Node.

I'm Microsoft Certified and an Umbraco Certified Developer, and previously I've worked for Shout Digital, Places for People and Fat Media.
