# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Rick, and I'm a full stack lead software engineer from the UK.**

I'm currently working as a Senior Developer at [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) where I get to build Umbracao's paid products and add-ons, as well as the main umbraco.com website. This means I'm working across tech stacksâ€”C# .NET, SQL and Umbraco as well as HTML, CSS and JS.

I'm a [3Ã— Umbraco MVP](https://umbraco.com/blog/the-umbraco-2023-mvps/), [Certified Master](https://umbraco.com/training/certified-developers/developer/?uid=41360) and part of the [Umbraco Community Sustainability Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/meet-the-new-community-sustainability-team/).
